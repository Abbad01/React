    <!-- JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe what the UI should look like.

        Even though it looks like HTML, JSX is not HTML. It's a syntactic sugar that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, which gets
        compiled down to JavaScript by tools like Babel. 
        
        üß† Why Was JSX Introduced?
         React is all about building UI using JavaScript. But writing HTML inside React.createElement(...) is hard to read and write. JSX gives us a cleaner and 
         more readable way to describe UI components.

         üßæ Example Comparison
         ‚úÖ Using JSX:
         const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
         ‚ùå Without JSX:
          const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');

          ‚öôÔ∏è How JSX Works Under the Hood
JSX is not understood by browsers. It's first compiled by Babel into React.createElement() calls.

For example:

const element = <h1 className="greet">Hello</h1>;

Is compiled to:

const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  { className: 'greet' },
  'Hello'
);

‚úÖ JSX Features (Detailed)
1. Embedding Expressions with {}
You can write JavaScript expressions inside JSX by using {}.

const name = "Abbad";
const greeting = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
You can include variables, expressions, function calls, ternaries, etc.

2. JSX Must Have One Parent Element
This is required because React.createElement() must return one root node.

// ‚ùå Wrong
return (
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>Welcome</p>
);

// ‚úÖ Right - Wrap with a div or fragment
return (
  <>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome</p>
  </>
);
3. Attributes Use camelCase
Because JSX is JavaScript, all attributes follow JS-style naming:

HTML	                    JSX
class                 	className
for                     	htmlFor
onclick	                  onClick

4. JSX Prevents Injection Attacks
JSX escapes any values embedded in it before rendering ‚Äî this means it's safe from XSS attacks by default.

5. JSX Can Contain Children

const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is JSX</p>
  </div>
);

        -->
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
